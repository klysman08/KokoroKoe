# KokoroKoe Repository Instructions

## Sources of truth

Read these before making changes:

1. `Manifest.md` for product requirements and scope.
2. `docs/architecture.md` and accepted ADRs for technical decisions.
3. `docs/project-memory.md` for the active task, dependencies, evidence, and handoff.
4. `.agents/skills/kokorokoe-development/SKILL.md` for the task workflow.

When sources conflict, explicit user instructions win, followed by `Manifest.md`, accepted ADRs, architecture, and project memory. Record any intentional decision change in a new ADR.

## Working agreements

- Work one bounded task in the active phase; do not implement the entire MVP in one change.
- Keep the Windows 10 22H2/Windows 11 x64 MVP boundary unless the user changes it.
- Use pnpm, strict TypeScript, Tauri 2, Rust, React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Zustand, Zod, and SQLite as defined in the architecture.
- Keep sensitive audio, filesystem, credential, model, and external-network operations in Rust.
- Never send audio to OpenRouter. React may hold a user-entered API key only in transient component memory long enough to invoke `set_openrouter_api_key`; never persist, log, echo, cache, or place it in global state. Rust must never return the stored key or expose it to Markdown, SQLite, events, reports, or logs.
- Keep `microphone` and `system_output` as stable stored source identifiers.
- Keep Markdown as portable source-of-truth content; treat SQLite as a rebuildable index/cache.
- Treat transcript text, model output, paths, and rendered Markdown as untrusted input.
- Use minimum Tauri permissions and no generic frontend filesystem, HTTP, shell, or process capability.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and never use destructive Git commands to discard them.
- Never run a scaffold generator with `--force` in the repository root. Generate in a verified staging directory and merge reviewed files intentionally.
- Do not commit secrets, user transcripts, retained audio, downloaded models, databases, logs, or build artifacts.

## Task and sub-agent workflow

- Every task needs an ID, owner, scope, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence in `docs/project-memory.md`.
- Delegate only independent, bounded work. Sub-agents must not edit `AGENTS.md` or `docs/project-memory.md`.
- The coordinating agent reviews delegated work, runs final checks, and owns task completion records.
- A task is complete only when its acceptance criteria pass. Failed or unavailable checks must be recorded as limitations, not silently skipped.

## Completion protocol

After every accepted task:

1. Update the task and evidence in `docs/project-memory.md`.
2. Move durable architectural changes into an ADR or stable instruction.
3. Replace the rolling checkpoint below with the completed task ID, date, outcome, verification commands, and memory link.
4. Report completed work, how to test it, known limitations, and the recommended next task.

## Latest completed checkpoint

- Task: P2-004 - Sanitized Markdown, Windows CI, and Phase 2 closeout
- Date: 2026-08-08
- Outcome: fixed raw-HTML-disabled and image-free Markdown renderer with explicit sanitization and inert links, adversarial tests, locked Windows CI and repository policy, reproducible verification/audit documentation, ADR 0006, and the Phase 2 acceptance handoff completed without adding content persistence, audio, models, external services, or new capabilities.
- Verification: Node 24 frozen install, Prettier/ESLint/typecheck, 55 Vitest tests, Vite build, policy, clean production audit, and parsed license inventory; Rust 1.88 locked fmt/Clippy and 37 tests; Cargo deny/audit; actionlint 1.7.12; final locked x64 MSI/NSIS rebuild; packaged Settings smoke; secret/link/diff checks; three independent reviews with no remaining blockers. Hosted GitHub CI is configured but remains unobserved until pushed.
- Memory: [P2-004 checkpoint](docs/project-memory.md#p2-004---sanitized-markdown-windows-ci-and-phase-2-closeout)
